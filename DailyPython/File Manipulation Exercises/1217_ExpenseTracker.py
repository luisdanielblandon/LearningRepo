# Create a command-line app to track daily expenses. The app allows users
# to add expenses, view a summary of all expenses, and calculate total
# spending for a given period. It's great for practicing file handling,
# date manipulation, and list/dictionary management.
# 
# Here is what the app does exactly:
#     Add Expense: Input the date, category, description, and amount.
#     View All Expenses: Display all recorded expenses in a neat tabular format
#     Search Expenses by Date: View expenses for a specific date or range of 
#     dates.
#     Calculate Total Spending: Show the total amount spent across all
#     categories
#     Save and Load Data: Save expense records to a file and load them on
#     app start.

# Required libraries: datetime, prettytable, os
